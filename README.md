# Language_Exchange
Built a full-stack language-learning app connecting native English and Korean speakers with learners. Uses Node.js, React.js, and MySQL, with a Socket.IO chat platform for instant messaging and user pairing. This is the fourth iteration, evolving from the project at https://github.com/shaiksaahir/JID_4203_Language_Exchange .
